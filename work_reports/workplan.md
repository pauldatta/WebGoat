# Workplan for Vulnerability Remediation

This document outlines the plan to address the remaining 27 vulnerabilities in the WebGoat repository.

## Phase 1: Java Vulnerabilities

The following Java vulnerabilities have been identified from the latest SARIF report:

* `java/polynomial-redos`
* `java/sql-injection`
* `java/xxe`
* `java/path-injection`
* `java/unsafe-deserialization`
* `java/missing-jwt-signature-check`

### Step 1: `java/missing-jwt-signature-check`

This vulnerability was previously fixed, but the fix was reverted due to build issues. The plan is to re-address this vulnerability with a more compatible solution.

1. **Identify all occurrences** of the `java/missing-jwt-signature-check` vulnerability by querying the `java.sarif` file.
2. **Analyze the code** in each identified file to understand the context of the vulnerability.
3. **Implement a fix** that correctly verifies the JWT signature without breaking the build. This may involve using a different method or library, or updating the existing library to a version that supports the desired functionality.
4. **Run the pre-commit hooks** to ensure that the fix does not introduce any new build errors.

### Step 2: Other Java Vulnerabilities

After addressing the `java/missing-jwt-signature-check` vulnerability, I will proceed to fix the remaining Java vulnerabilities in the following order:

1. `java/unsafe-deserialization`
2. `java/path-injection`
3. `java/xxe`
4. `java/sql-injection`
5. `java/polynomial-redos`

For each of these vulnerabilities, I will follow the same process as outlined in Step 1.

## Phase 2: JavaScript Vulnerabilities

After all Java vulnerabilities have been addressed, I will move on to the JavaScript vulnerabilities. The following vulnerabilities have been identified from the latest SARIF report:

* `js/path-injection`
* `js/polynomial-redos`
* Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (`jquery-ui-1.10.4.js` and `jquery.form.js`)

### Step 1: `js/path-injection` and `js/polynomial-redos`

I will address these vulnerabilities first, following the same process as outlined in Phase 1, Step 1.

### Step 2: Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities

The vulnerabilities in `jquery-ui-1.10.4.js` and `jquery.form.js` will not be patched directly. Instead, the plan is to upgrade these libraries to a newer, secure version. This will be done as a separate task after all other vulnerabilities have been addressed.

## Phase 3: Final Verification

After all vulnerabilities have been addressed, I will run a final CodeQL scan to verify that all issues have been resolved. I will then commit the changes and create a new pull request.
