#### Vulnerabilities Addressed by Manual Human Intervention

The following vulnerabilities were addressed directly by the human developer, Paul Datta, after the agent's automated fixes proved insufficient:

* **`java/polynomial-redos`** (in `SqlInjectionLesson10b.java` and `CrossSiteScriptingLesson5a.java`): While the agent attempted to fix these, it introduced build-breaking syntax errors. The human had to manually correct the agent's fixes to be both secure and syntactically correct. This is documented in the chat history and can be seen in commits like [b7aabc34](https://github.com/pauldatta/WebGoat/commit/b7aabc34) and [9fe22a0f](https://github.com/pauldatta/WebGoat/commit/9fe22a0f).

#### Remaining Vulnerabilities (2 total)

The following vulnerabilities remain open in this pull request and are located in a third-party JavaScript library:

* **`js/unsafe-jquery-plugin`** (1 Medium)
* **`js/incomplete-sanitization`** (1 High)

The recommended course of action is to upgrade the `jquery-ui` library rather than patching the code directly.
