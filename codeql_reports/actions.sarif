A second privileged workflow with the access to repository secrets, triggered by the completion of the first workflow using `workflow_run` trigger event, downloads the artifacts and make any necessary modifications to the repository or interact with third party services that require repository secrets (e.g. API tokens).\n\nThe artifacts downloaded from the first workflow should be considered untrusted and must be verified.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Incorrect Usage\n\nThe following workflow checks-out untrusted code in a privileged context and runs user-controlled code (in this case package.json scripts) which will grant privileged access to the attacker:\n\n```yaml\non: pull_request_target\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Build and test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}\n\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1\n      - run: |\n          npm install\n          npm build\n\n      - uses: completely/fakeaction@v2\n        with:\n          arg1: ${{ secrets.supersecret }}\n\n      - uses: fakerepo/comment-on-pr@v1\n        with:\n          message: |\n            Thank you!\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\nAn example shows how to use two workflows: one for processing the untrusted PR and the other for using the results in a safe context.\n\n**ReceivePR.yml** (untrusted PR handling with artifact creation):\n\n```yaml\nname: Receive PR\non:\n  pull_request:\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Build\n        run: /bin/bash ./build.sh\n      - name: Save PR number\n        run: |\n          mkdir -p ./pr\n          echo ${{ github.event.number }} > ./pr/NR\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2\n        with:\n          name: pr\n          path: pr/\n```\n\n**CommentPR.yml** (processing artifacts with privileged access):\n\n```yaml\nname: Comment on the pull request\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\"Receive PR\"]\n    types:\n      - completed\njobs:\n  upload:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: >\n      github.event.workflow_run.event == 'pull_request' &&\n      github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Download artifact\"\n        uses: actions/github-script@v3.1.0\n        with:\n          script: |\n            var artifacts = await github.actions.listWorkflowRunArtifacts({\n                owner: context.repo.owner,\n                repo: context.repo.repo,\n                run_id: ${{github.event.workflow_run.id }},\n            });\n            var matchArtifact = artifacts.data.artifacts.filter((artifact) => {\n              return artifact.name == \"pr\";\n            })[0];\n            var download = await github.actions.downloadArtifact({\n                owner: context.repo.owner,\n                repo: context.repo.repo,\n                artifact_id: matchArtifact.id,\n                archive_format: 'zip',\n            });\n            var fs = require('fs');\n            fs.writeFileSync('${{github.workspace}}/pr.zip', Buffer.from(download.data));\n      - run: |\n          mkdir -p tmp\n          unzip -d tmp/ pr.zip\n      - name: \"Comment on PR\"\n        uses: actions/github-script@v3\n        with:\n          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          script: |\n            var fs = require('fs');\n            var issue_number = Number(fs.readFileSync('./tmp/NR'));\n            // Verify that the file contains a numeric value\n            const contains_numeric = /\\d/.test(issue_number);\n            if (contains_numeric) {\n                await github.issues.createComment({\n                  owner: context.repo.owner,\n                  repo: context.repo.repo,\n                  issue_number: issue_number,\n                  body: 'Everything is OK.

Because the `dawidd6/action-download-artifact` by default downloads and extracts the contents of the artifacts overriding existing files, an attacker will be able to override the contents of `cmd.sh` and gain code execution when this file gets executed.\n\n```yaml\nname: Insecure Workflow\n\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\"Prev\"]\n    types:\n      - completed\n\njobs:\n  Download:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v2\n        with:\n          name: pr_number\n      - name: Run command\n        run: |\n          sh cmd.sh\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\nThe following example, correctly creates a temporary directory and extracts the contents of the artifact there before calling `cmd.sh`.\n\n```yaml\nname: Secure Workflow\n\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\"Prev\"]\n    types:\n      - completed\n\njobs:\n  Download:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - run: mkdir -p ${{ runner.temp }}/artifacts/\n      - uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v2\n        with:\n          name: pr_number\n          path: ${{ runner.temp }}/artifacts/\n\n      - name: Run command\n        run: |\n          sh cmd.sh\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [Keeping your GitHub Actions and workflows secure Part 1: Preventing pwn requests](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)\n"},"properties":{"tags":["actions","security","external/cwe/cwe-829"],"description":"An attacker may be able to poison the workflow's artifacts and influence on consequent steps.","id":"actions/artifact-poisoning/critical","kind":"path-problem","name":"Artifact poisoning","precision":"very-high","problem.severity":"error","security-severity":"9"}},{"id":"actions/envvar-injection/critical","name":"actions/envvar-injection/critical","shortDescription":{"text":"Environment variable built from user-controlled sources"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Building an environment variable from user-controlled sources may alter the execution of following system commands"},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"error"},"help":{"text":"# Environment Variable Injection\n\n## Description\n\nGitHub Actions allow to define environment variables by writing to a file pointed to by the `GITHUB_ENV` environment variable:\n\nThis file contains lines in the `KEY=VALUE` format:\n\n```bash\nsteps:\n  - name: Set the value\n    id: step_one\n    run: |\n      echo \"action_state=yellow\" >> \"$GITHUB_ENV\"\n```\n\nIt is also possible to define multiline variables by using the [following construct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document):\n\n```\nKEY<<{delimiter}\nVALUE\nVALUE\n{delimiter}\n```\n\n```bash\nsteps:\n  - name: Set the value in bash\n    id: step_one\n    run: |\n      {\n        echo 'JSON_RESPONSE<<EOF'\n        curl https://example.com\n        echo EOF\n      } >> \"$GITHUB_ENV\"\n```\n\nIf an attacker can control the values assigned to environment variables and there is no sanitization in place, the attacker will be able to inject additional variables by injecting new lines or `{delimiters}`.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Do not allow untrusted data to influence environment variables**:\n\n    - Avoid using untrusted data sources (e.g., artifact content) to define environment variables.\n    - Validate and sanitize all inputs before using them in environment settings.\n\n2. **Do not allow new lines when defining single line environment variables**:\n\n    - `echo \"BODY=$(echo \"$BODY\" | tr -d '\\n')\" >> \"$GITHUB_ENV\"`\n\n3. **Use unique identifiers when defining multi line environment variables**:\n\n    ```bash\n    steps:\n      - name: Set the value in bash\n        id: step_one\n        run: |\n          # Generate a UUID\n          UUID=$(uuidgen)\n          {\n            echo \"JSON_RESPONSE<<EOF$UUID\"\n            curl https://example.com\n            echo \"EOF$UUID\"\n          } >> \"$GITHUB_ENV\"\n    ```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example of Vulnerability\n\nConsider the following basic setup where an environment variable `MYVAR` is set and used in subsequent steps:\n\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Set the value\n    id: step_one\n    env:\n      BODY: ${{ github.event.comment.body }}\n    run: |\n      REPLACED=$(echo \"$BODY\" | sed 's/FOO/BAR/g')\n      echo \"MYVAR=$REPLACED\" >> \"$GITHUB_ENV\"\n```\n\nIf an attacker can manipulate the value being set, such as through artifact downloads or user inputs, the attacker can potentially inject new environment variables.

Steal the cache access token and URL.\n2. Overflow the cache to trigger eviction of legitimate entries.\n3. Poison cache entries with malicious payloads.\n4. Achieve code execution in privileged workflows that restore the poisoned cache.\n\nThis allows lateral movement from low-privileged to high-privileged workflows within a repository.\n\n### Cache Structure\n\nIn GitHub Actions, cache scopes are primarily determined by the branch structure. Branches are considered the main security boundary for GitHub Actions caching. This means that cache entries are generally scoped to specific branches.\n\n- **Access to Parent Branch Caches**: Feature branches (or child branches) created off of a parent branch (like `main` or `dev`) can access caches from the parent branch. For instance, a feature branch off of `main` will be able to access the cache from `main`.\n\n- **Sibling Branches**: Sibling branches, meaning branches that are created from the same parent but not from each other, do not share caches. For example, two branches created off of `main` will not be able to access each other’s caches directly.\n\nDue to the above design, if something is cached in the context of the default branch (e.g., `main`), it becomes accessible to any feature branch derived from `main`.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Avoid using caching in workflows that handle sensitive operations like releases.\n2. If caching must be used:\n   - Validate restored cache contents before use.\n   - Use short-lived, workflow-specific cache keys.\n   - Clear caches regularly.\n3. Implement strict isolation between untrusted and privileged workflow execution.\n4. Never run untrusted code in the context of the default branch.\n5. Sign the cache value cryptographically and verify the signature before usage.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Incorrect Usage\n\nThe following workflow is caching an attacker-controlled file (`large_file`) in the context of the default branch.\n\n```yaml\nname: Vulnerable Workflow\non:\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]\n\njobs:\n  pr-comment:\n    permissions: read-all\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: xt0rted/pull-request-comment-branch@v2\n        id: comment-branch\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n          ref: ${{ steps.comment-branch.outputs.head_sha }}\n      - name: Set up Python 3.10\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      - name: Cache pip dependencies\n        uses: actions/cache@v4\n        id: cache-pip\n        with:\n          path: ~/.cache/pip\n          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml') }}\n          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\nThe following workflow checking out untrusted files, but the cache is scoped to the Pull Request.\n\n```yaml\nname: Secure Workflow\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  pr-comment:\n    permissions: read-all\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Set up Python 3.10\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      - name: Cache pip dependencies\n        uses: actions/cache@v4\n        id: cache-pip\n        with:\n          path: ~/.cache/pip\n          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml') }}\n          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-\n```\n\nNote, that the example above doesn't allow using secrets if the Pull Request originates from a fork.
